                    Welcome to my journey with artificial intelligence (AI) within this course. 
                    Throughout this portfolio, I'm excited to share how I've delved into the world of AI both as a part of this course, 
                    and using it within my both major and life. I’ll focus on some key concepts that I think encapsulate the very 
                    idea of interacting with AI. This portfolio will showcase these ideas with my exploration of AI's complexities, including 
                    but not limited to, the practical applications of AI itself and its concepts, tough ethical and moral considerations, 
                    and finally demonstrating an understanding of the overarching impacts of AI on individuals and society.

                    Firstly, through the lectures and the tutorials with occasional guest speakers, I have been exposed to a wide variety 
                    of applications and tools available in the world currently. As this was my first real experience utilizing AI, a wide 
                    variety of concepts I was exposed to helped to understand how AI could work for me. Some of these ideas such as resume 
                    writing, topic brainstorming, image generation and source summaries were applications that, when paired with careful 
                    observation and consideration, were instrumental to developing my understanding of the incredible utility of AI.

                <h1>
                    Through both my knowledge sharing slides and debate reflections, I hope to demonstrate some ethical and moral dilemmas 
                    that AI introduces. Within the knowledge sharing section, I’ll explore some ideas that I researched over the term for 
                    my presentations and incorporate both feedback from my peers as well as ideas presented to me through their presentations 
                    to me. I’ll also dive into some of the problematic notions that AI gives rise to within the insights of both debates and 
                    give my final thoughts on each stance and how they will likely play out in the future with the rise of AI in the world.

                    Finally, I’d like to summarise the overarching concepts of AI on individuals and demonstrate my personal growth and 
                    understanding of how AI can help overall. This will be demonstrated in the final proposal that will follow the idea of 
                    using AI as a collaborative tool, assisting even the everyday man with complex ideas such as creating a specialised tool, 
                    or even a game.

                    Overall, throughout this term it has been explicitly demonstrated to me through both teaching and interactive experiences 
                    that AI is an extremely useful tool. Although it may be limited in its current state, it is still a useful aid for a variety 
                    of use cases when designed responsibly and with generative AI, trained ethically.
