                    One main takeaway that I gained from the lectures and tutorials, as well as 
                    the knowledge sharing component, is utilising AI as a tool and partner can be 
                    very beneficial. As such, I wanted my proposal to focus around using AI as a 
                    cooperator, almost acting as a teacher or co-worker within a design team. Since 
                    the intricacies and usefulness of AI had been demonstrated to me, the aim of 
                    this proposal is to present and answer the question: “Can an interactive 
                    application, or even a game, be created solely using prompts to AI with no 
                    prior knowledge?”

                    Before undertaking this course, I already had an idea that I wanted to create 
                    a video game or application, unfortunately, I didn’t know how to start or what 
                    tech stack was best for my situation. As a software engineer and developer, I’m 
                    quite familiar with the design process, from brainstorming to developing, testing, 
                    and finally deploying. This however only really relates to the backend of projects 
                    and products, where I’ll be mostly working on features and how they work, rather 
                    than how they look and interact with one another on the page. My overall idea slowly 
                    evolved into using this portfolio as a baseline and proof of concept, using ChatGPT 
                    3.5 to help me learn and develop an interactive website.

                    Before this course, I hadn’t used any of the languages I’ve used to create this 
                    portfolio (html, css, javascript) or even an AI assistant like ChatGPT. As a proof 
                    of concept, I made sure that my prototype solution (this portfolio) was almost 
                    exclusively created by interacting with a generative AI such as ChatGPT 3.5 (rather 
                    than googling all my problems) as well as image generators like Stable Diffusion 
                    and NightCafe. It was a deliberate choice to make all the components from tools that 
                    are widely available and free to use, but it’s the case that you will receive better 
                    results from following this process with the paid varieties of these tools.

                <h1>
                    Since ChatGPT is an algorithm trained under a supervised learning model and learning 
                    the association between words before predicting the outputs, guardrails had to be 
                    developed so that certain outputs were omitted. This limits the outputs of the program 
                    which could mean that certain ideas wouldn’t be possible to create. Another problem 
                    arises from the fact that a lot of the starting code and all images were generated by 
                    both ChatGPT and NightCafe, a bias would emerge from the general biases that both 
                    algorithms contain. Over time, similar or even identical concepts could be developed 
                    leading to concerns of copyright and AI ownership issues like the examples raised 
                    within the debates.

                    Overall, this concept can demonstrate to anyone that they can create something beyond 
                    their understanding of something like coding or art. Use this as motivation! Although 
                    AI is limited in terms of large-scale projects, small-scale projects undertaken by 
                    individuals and small teams can greatly benefit from the added assistance. Even after 
                    learning the basics from your personal teaching buddy, there’s nothing stopping you 
                    and I from delving into more complex topics in terms of games like 3D modelling and 
                    physics engines. I think AI will over time, help a wider range of people to create 
                    ideas that may have only lived within their dreams otherwise.

                    As a secondary concept, with a developed game, I wanted to utilise AI to create an 
                    interactive chat feature within the game, where all responses were generated at the 
                    speaking time, based on the players friendship/previous interactions with both the 
                    characters and the world around them. I saw this idea utilised in one of our lectures, 
                    but I wanted the interactions to also include the playable character that someone 
                    playing the game would control (rather than just AI’s talking to one another within 
                    the game).

                <h1>
                    On the interactive AI responses within a game, a proposed solution would be to feed a 
                    model a significant amount of communication and relationship data , either through a 
                    simulation or even some real-life interactions, to build up the framework that would 
                    allow the AI controlled characters to have their own “personalities” and interact with 
                    the player character/s differently each time. Unfortunately, a limitation of this system 
                    would be language, as it will be very difficult to train multiple models, one for each 
                    common language. Otherwise, I find this to be quite interesting and a new take on a 
                    wide variety of game genres.

                    The machine learning algorithm used will be trained by a form of supervised learning to 
                    make sure that the AI is properly trained on conversations that are common within the 
                    English language already. A positive of using this form of algorithm would be the fact 
                    that there is a lot of human interaction to make sure that the algorithm is picking up 
                    stereotypical and socially correct behaviours. One huge negative would be the significant 
                    time sink that organising and labelling of conversations for the algorithm would take. 
                    Although, with careful observation, a self-fed algorithm could be developed over time 
                    that then starts making up its own conversations by itself (what we are looking for in 
                    terms of our game context).

                    With any training model, bias is sure to emerge. Risks based on ethical considerations 
                    of logging data from humans will also infringe on people’s privacy as with millions and 
                    billions of data points, there is sure to be they might see their own relationships 
                    reflected by the model. One potential way to mitigate these risks would be to train the 
                    model on purely simulations. These simulations could be prompted initially and then left 
                    to develop over many iterations of learning, rather than being based on information that 
                    would have not all been ethically acquired.

                    The secondary concept could mean that the development of personalised experiences within 
                    video games is significantly more accessible and easier. The processing power would be 
                    significant if the information and such was stored on a server, but I’m sure that once 
                    the functionality is there, storage space and computation won’t be that big of an issue 
                    if Moore’s law keeps as it has. Unfortunately, I don’t think that it will be super 
                    beneficial in the long run as there’s a possibility that many people will use AI to 
                    replace their social connections and it might detrimentally affect many lives (like 
                    the plot of Her).

                    Concluding, both developing this project and brainstorming the secondary proposal 
                    was incredibly interesting. I think the combination of learning a new coding language 
                    and the design process a component that I’m not at all familiar with, made it so that 
                    the learning process had the satisfying ups and downs of learning something new. I can 
                    also say a lot of the ideas that led to this proposal/project developed from both 
                    research during the knowledge sharing and topics discussed each week within the tutorials.

                <h1>
                    I think over the course of the term, the act of creating my project seemed easier as I was 
                    exposed to the usefulness of a large variety of free AI tools like NightCafe and ChatGPT 3.5.
                    Before this course I tried to stay away from chatbots and other tools since I mostly didn’t 
                    understand the innerworkings of the algorithms or trust the outputs. As much as I still am 
                    wary, the usefulness is something I have come to incorporate into some facets of my career, 
                    arguably saving time in the process.

                    I used AI to generate almost all the images seen in my portfolio (minus the pictures within 
                    knowledge sharing) as well as the initial code that I adapted to create the formatting and 
                    inner working of the portfolio. Using image generation tools saved a significant amount of 
                    time trying to find or create images that I wanted to use for each page (although it took a 
                    lot of prompting!). As I also had no experience with any of the coding languages that I used 
                    in this portfolio, getting a head start into learning and using html, css and javascript from 
                    ChatGPT was quite useful. This meant I had more time to develop my ideas and have them visible 
                    for the final presentation. Without prompt engineering, something we learned within an early 
                    tutorial, I would have been stuck throwing bad prompts into each tool, ending up being a 
                    significant hinderance to the time taken to create the proposal. As such, I can confirm that 
                    prompt engineering is a valuable skill that I’m thankful to have learning as we move into a 
                    more AI focused atmosphere.

                    One thing I wish I did better over the duration of this course would be pushing for feedback 
                    each week, making sure that I understood everything that was taking place within the course
                    and able to incorporate each section into making my life more efficient. Overall, it is evident 
                    that AI is an incredibly valuable tool that is possible to be utilised by absolutely anyone. The 
                    learning curve is quite simple and with the correct guidance, can benefit everyone in some way. 
                    Thank you to Alba and Sam especially, as well as Hayden and Guests for the interactive and 
                    informative course!
