                    only focusing on negative of less human interaction</h1>

                    A little bit biased, but I feel pro team’s points addressed most of the cons concerns well, would have been better if I 
                    didn’t pause in the middle and lock up. Mostly decided because con team didn’t really address points of the pro team, 
                    just talked about their own points.

                    Interestingly, I found that the information from the con team about pricing was a lot cheaper than I expected and that 
                    the trade off for better hires with a slightly more costly hiring process should just be a no brainer. More costly means 
                    it probably won’t happen though.

                    it seemed that the con team had a rebuttal for each one. Also didn’t like how the pro team trying to close the 
                    scope/“ignore” main pitfalls against their points.

                <h1>
                    Primary takeaway is that AI isn’t human, so therefore the replication and emulation of emotions reduce these 
                    experiences to some maths on a machine. Also, AI doesn’t innovate and thus doesn’t augment humans but instead 
                    de-innovates as many will continue to rely on AI if they start with it.
